## Description

This project is designed to help you get started with NodeJS. By the end of this project, you should be able to run JavaScript using NodeJS, create HTTP servers, and understand the basics of the Express framework.

## Learning Objectives

- Run JavaScript using NodeJS
- Use NodeJS modules
- Read files using NodeJS
- Access command line arguments and the environment using the process module
- Create HTTP servers using NodeJS and ExpressJS
- Use ES6 with NodeJS using Babel-node
- Develop faster using Nodemon

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using node (version 12.x.x)
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the js extension
- Your code will be tested using Jest and the command `npm run test`
- Your code will be verified against lint using ESLint
- Your code needs to pass all the tests and lint. You can verify the entire project running `npm run full-test`
- All of your functions/classes must be exported by using this format: `module.exports = myFunction;`
