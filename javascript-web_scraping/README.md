## Project Description

Web scraping involves extracting data from websites by sending HTTP requests, parsing HTML, and navigating through the Document Object Model (DOM). In this project, you will explore various techniques and tools for web scraping using JavaScript.

Topics covered in this project include:

- Sending HTTP requests with JavaScript
- Parsing HTML using libraries like Cheerio
- Navigating the DOM tree
- Extracting data from web pages
- Handling asynchronous operations
- Storing and processing scraped data

By the end of this project, you will have the skills and knowledge to create web scraping scripts that can retrieve data from websites of your choice.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** The primary programming language for this project.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment used for running JavaScript code on the server-side.
- **Cheerio:** A fast, flexible, and lean implementation of jQuery for server-side DOM manipulation.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests.
- **File System (fs) Module:** For reading and writing files in the Node.js environment.

## Setup

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/holberton-web-scraping.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd holberton-web-scraping
```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the web scraping scripts provided in this project, you can use the following command:

```
node script.js
```

Replace `script.js` with the name of the specific script you want to run. Be sure to review the code in each script to understand how it works and modify it to suit your web scraping needs.
